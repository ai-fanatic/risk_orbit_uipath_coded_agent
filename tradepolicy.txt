   • Duty credit scripts for hydrogen-energy projects increased from 3% to 5%.  
   • Mandatory electronic filing for all Letters of Undertaking (LUT) for exports under bond.  
   • Import restrictions tightened on used electrical machinery to reduce e-waste.  
   Expected Impact: Boost to renewable-energy exports but slower clearance for used-equipment imports.

2. CHINA – DUAL-USE TECHNOLOGY EXPORT REGULATION REVISION (No. 67/2025)
   Effective December 1 2025.  
   Expands the “restricted dual-use” list to include AI-assisted robotic controllers and advanced turbine control software.  
   Exporters must obtain licensing from the State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (SASTIND).  
   Non-compliance penalty: Fines up to ¥5 million and suspension of export privileges for two years.  
   Note: Reactions from EU manufacturers suggest concern over supply chain disruptions in wind energy components.

3. VIETNAM – CIRCULAR 28/2025 ON DIGITAL CUSTOMS INTEGRATION
   Introduces blockchain-based import clearance for low-risk traders. Each shipment will be assigned a unique Digital Compliance Token (DCT).  
   The initiative is expected to reduce average customs processing time from 41 hours to 11 hours by mid-2026.  
   Pilot implementation in Ho Chi Minh and Da Nang ports.

4. SOUTH KOREA – TRADE REMEDIES ACT AMENDMENT (2025)
   Enables automatic sunset review of anti-dumping duties every five years.

   Non-compliant firms will see priority clearance revoked and may lose customs rebates.

2. SAUDI ARABIA – GCC INTEGRATION OF TRADE DATABASES
   Announced jointly with Bahrain and Oman.  
   A shared Trade Data Interchange Platform (TDIP) goes live January 2026, enabling real-time tracking of certificates of origin and tariff quotas.  
   The initiative aligns with Vision 2030’s goal to cut paper-based clearances by 90%.  
   Each member state will harmonize its Standard Import Classification (SIC) codes with the World Customs Organization (WCO).

3. QATAR – STRATEGIC TRADE MODERNIZATION PROGRAM (2025-2028)
   Focus Areas:
   • Automation of import licensing via Q-Trade Portal.  
   • Revised tariff bands for industrial machinery (3–6%).  
   • Digital risk rating for suppliers based on historical compliance.  
   • Pilot integration with UiPath-style workflow bots for real-time certificate validation.  
   Expected Result: Reduction in average port dwell time from 7 to 3 days by 2027.

4. EGYPT – NEW RULES ON FOREIGN CURRENCY PAYMENTS FOR IMPORTS
   Effective November 22 2025. Importers must settle invoices in the currency of origin unless a central-bank hedging agreement is in place.

   Firms with five-year compliance records receive automatic clearance within four hours of vessel arrival.  
   12 new bilateral agreements signed with ASEAN partners for mutual recognition of standards.  
   The policy removes duplicate document requirements for electrical machinery and pharmaceutical goods.

3. UNITED STATES – CLEAN MANUFACTURING INCENTIVE ACT
   Passed October 2025. Provides tax credits for importers who source from low-carbon manufacturing countries.  
   Tariff rebates of up to 4% for products with certified emission intensity below baseline.  
   The Department of Commerce will publish eligible supplier lists quarterly.  
   Potential benefit for Vietnamese solar and Indian wind component exporters.

4. CANADA – IMPORT CONTROL AMENDMENTS
   Restricts entry of goods linked to forced labor allegations under Bill S-211.

SECTION E – ANALYTICAL SUMMARY FOR AGENT IMPLEMENTATION
───────────────────────────────────────────────
► Emerging Themes
   • Digitalization of trade clearance (Vietnam, Brazil, UK).  
   • Environmental and social compliance linkages (UAE, Canada, South Africa).  
   • Tariff realignments for strategic manufacturing (Qatar, India, Kenya).  
   • Shift toward regional data interchange (Saudi TDIP, EAC platforms).

► Agent Extraction Guidelines
   1. Detect phrases like “Effective date”, “Decree No.”, “Duty rebate”, “Certification requirement”, “Digital Portal”, “Environmental criterion”.  
   2. Extract:
      – Country / Region  
      – Policy title or identifier  
      – Sector (energy, manufacturing, logistics)  
      – Effective date  
      – Compliance impact (high / medium / low)
   3. Assign a Trade Policy Risk Index (TPRI) on a 0–100 scale:
      • > 70 = High uncertainty  
      • 40–70 = Moderate watchlist  
      • < 40 = Stable

► Recommended Agent Output Format
