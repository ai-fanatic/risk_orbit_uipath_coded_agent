GLOBAL TRADE & TARIFF MONITOR – NOVEMBER 2025 ISSUE

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 1: ASIA-PACIFIC TRADE POLICY UPDATES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Indonesia Ministry of Finance (MoF Regulation No. 115/2025)
   Effective: November 10, 2025  
   Description: Indonesia has introduced a revised import duty schedule for
   industrial machinery and power generation components. Gas turbines,
   compressors, and control panels classified under HS 8411, 8414, and 8537
   will now attract a 7% base tariff, up from 5%. 
   Purpose: To protect domestic fabrication units in Java and Banten.  
   Impact: All shipments entering through Jakarta Port or Surabaya after the
   effective date will need updated certificate-of-origin documentation.
   Notes: Transit shipments dispatched before November 10 remain exempt.

2. Vietnam General Department of Customs Circular 31/2025
   Effective: November 15, 2025  
   The Vietnamese government has announced a zero-duty concession on
   photovoltaic modules, inverters, and racking structures used in solar
   energy projects larger than 10MW. Importers must file proof of project
   registration and environmental compliance to qualify for the exemption.
   The concession will remain valid through December 2027.

3. Philippines Bureau of Customs (BoC Administrative Order 2025-17)
   Effective: November 12, 2025  
   All imports of substation equipment exceeding USD 250,000 in declared
   value are now subject to a risk-based inspection framework.
   Duties remain unchanged (8%), but customs inspection fees have risen by
   2% to cover digital scanning and traceability costs.
   Shipments routed through Manila Port must include E-manifest data within
   24 hours prior to vessel arrival.

SECTION 2: MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA TRADE NOTICES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Qatar – Ministerial Decree 19/2025
   Effective: November 20, 2025  
   Tariff on imported hydraulic pumps and industrial valves increased from 3%
   to 6%. The measure was introduced following reports of under-invoicing by
   foreign suppliers. Domestic manufacturers have been granted temporary
   production subsidies to offset raw material inflation.  
   Compliance requirement: Certificate of conformity issued by Qatar
   Standards Authority (QSA).

2. Saudi Arabia Customs Bulletin 88/2025
   Effective: December 1, 2025  
   The Kingdom has temporarily suspended duty-free entry for mechanical and
   electrical components sourced from non-GCC countries.
   Tariffs of 5–9% now apply to turbine parts (HS 8411.99), compressor
   elements, and generator stators.  
   Exception: Goods with at least 40% GCC-origin content continue to qualify
   for intra-GCC zero duty.

3. United Arab Emirates Federal Customs Circular 32/2025
   Effective: October 30, 2025  
   Importers of heavy-duty electrical switchgear must pre-register via the
   Smart Trade Portal and pay an environmental handling fee of AED 150 per
   ton.  
   While the base tariff of 4% remains, failure to provide recyclable-material
   certification results in a surcharge of 1.5%.  
   UAE Customs also launched a blockchain-based origin-tracking system,
   which will be mandatory for all Maersk and MSC cargo by Q2 2026.

4. Egypt Customs Update
   Effective: November 18, 2025  
   Egypt introduced a safeguard duty of 10% on imported industrial boilers,
   citing a sharp increase in low-cost imports from East Asia.
   The duty will remain in effect for 200 days pending review by the WTO
   Safeguard Committee.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 3: EUROPE & NORTH AMERICA
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. European Commission Regulation 2025/2179
   Effective: November 1, 2025  
   The EU reinstated anti-dumping duties (12%) on Chinese-origin aluminum
   structures used in solar mounting systems.  
   Additionally, a carbon-adjustment surcharge of €18 per ton applies to all
   shipments where the supplier’s manufacturing process has a carbon
   intensity above 1.8 tons of CO₂ per ton of output.  
   Exemption: Suppliers certified under the EU GreenTech framework.

2. United Kingdom Trade Tariff Notice 45/2025
   Effective: November 16, 2025  
   The UK introduced a simplified tariff code for renewable-energy imports.
   Wind turbine blades (HS 8502.31) now have a reduced tariff rate of 2%,
   previously 4.5%.  
   However, electronic control systems (HS 8537) imported from outside
   approved markets (EU, US, Japan) are now subject to a 6% duty due to
   cybersecurity certification concerns.

3. United States International Trade Commission (ITC) – Investigation 337-T
   Preliminary ruling dated: October 25, 2025  
   Pending anti-circumvention duties on gas compressor assemblies imported
   from Indonesia and India suspected of being re-routed through Singapore.
   If confirmed, additional countervailing duties of 8% will apply beginning
   Q1 2026.

SECTION 4: ANALYTICAL NOTES FOR AGENT RISK CALCULATION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• The combined impact of the above policy shifts increases landed cost of
  turbine-related components across Asia by an average of 4.3%.

• For projects sourcing from **China, India, or Indonesia**, the net trade
  risk is rated **High** due to rising tariff volatility and policy
  uncertainty.  
  Recommendation: Hedge purchase orders with FOB-based contracts rather than
  CIF to minimize liability.

• **Vietnam** and **Singapore** remain low-risk sourcing hubs owing to
  green-energy incentives and stable tariff regimes.

• The agent should monitor **HS codes 8411, 8414, 8537**, and **8502**
  specifically, as they correspond to equipment categories used in the
  current Scheduler dataset.

SECTION 6: CONCLUSION & AGENT INSIGHT SUMMARY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall, the tariff environment in late 2025 presents mixed signals:
• Strong decarbonization-driven incentives in ASEAN markets.  
• Rising protectionism in GCC and North Africa.  
• New non-tariff barriers (documentation, digital traceability) are
  appearing as frequent compliance triggers.

Your Tariff & Trade Agent should:
1. Detect mentions of “Effective”, “Duty”, “Tariff”, “Surcharge”, “Rate”,
   “Increase”, or “Exemption”.
2. Extract:
   - Country
   - HS code
   - Affected product type
   - Rate change
   - Date of effect
3. Compute an estimated **Tariff Risk Index (TRI)** per PO, using country
   and product mappings from the Scheduler dataset.
4. Tag each record as:
   - “Favorable” (tariff reduced or zero-duty)
   - “Neutral” (no change)
   - “Unfavorable” (increase or new surcharge)
5. Pass structured output to the Reporting Agent for visualization.
